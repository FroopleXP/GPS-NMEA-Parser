# NMEA Parser for Bluetooth GPS Receiver
<p>If your GPS Bluetooth receiver doesn't support NMEA transmission over USB, you must configure your Arduino Bluetooth 
Transceiver to work as a Master node (I'm using the XM15B which has AT command support) in order to connect to the GPS receiver (slave).
Instructions on how to do so can be found below:

  <li>
    Connect your Bluetooth Transceiver to your computer via an FTDI controller. Your computer should recognise it straight, if so you 
    can connect to it via Serial Terminal program such as <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a>
    for Windows or comBIOS for Linux - you may also use the Serial Terminal built into the Arduino IDE.
